Overview","text":"<p>This project is an innovative concept for the hierarchical classification of complex textual requirements using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The tool proposes a multi-level analysis structure, combining clustering at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, supported by an intelligent assistant based on language models (LLMs) for iterative refinement and enriched results.</p> <p>The project arose from the needs of Educado, a platform dedicated to providing educational content for waste pickers and cooperatives, which faces the challenge of a large volume of technical and social documentation and requirements\u2014making manual organization and interpretation costly and error-prone.</p> <p>The solution aims to facilitate the organization and interpretation of these large volumes of documents and requirements, enhancing analysis through automation and artificial intelligence, and enabling faster and more reliable decision-making in the development and management of the platform.</p>"},{"location":"wiki_index/#2-motivation","title":"2. Motivation","text":"<p>The classification of textual requirements in complex projects faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneous, ambiguous, and voluminous nature of the data. Traditional methods, such as manual classification or simple grouping techniques, become insufficient when dealing with large volumes and multiple levels of hierarchy.</p> <p>In this context, the application of advanced NLP techniques and multi-level clustering allows for more granular and intuitive organization of requirements, facilitating understanding, prioritization, and decision-making.</p> <p>Moreover, the integration of language models (LLMs) as intelligent assistants to suggest refinements, adjust stopwords, and generate automatic labels increases the quality and efficiency of the process, reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy.</p> <p>This motivation is directly linked to the needs of the Educado project, which requires a system capable of handling large volumes and textual complexities to support its educational and social mission.</p>"},{"location":"wiki_index/#3-main-features","title":"3.

Issue Identification Identify and document issues that may impact the project. - Record issues as they arise during development, testing, or post-launch.  - Classify issues by severity, impact, and urgency.  - Capture detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs. 2. Issue Prioritization Assign priority levels to each issue based on its impact on the project. -Critical : Must be resolved immediately to prevent system failure.  - High : Needs urgent attention to avoid major disruptions.  - Medium : Important but does not affect critical functionalities.  - Low : Minor impact, can be addressed later. 3. Issue Assignment Assign issues to the appropriate team members for resolution. - Allocate issues based on team member expertise and workload.  - Set clear expectations on resolution deadlines and outcomes.  - Provide necessary resources or information for issue resolution. 4. Issue Resolution Resolve issues by implementing fixes or workarounds. - Address root causes of issues to prevent recurrence.  - Implement solutions and verify that the issue is fixed.  - Test thoroughly to ensure that the fix does not introduce new problems. 5. Verification and Closure Verify that resolved issues meet the defined acceptance criteria and close them. - Review the resolution with stakeholders and the team.  - Confirm that the issue no longer affects the project or product.  - Close the issue once it\u2019s resolved and communicate the outcome. 6. Documentation and Reporting Maintain a record of issues, resolutions, and lessons learned. - Update the issue tracking system with detailed information on each issue.  - Generate reports on issues, resolutions, and ongoing challenges.  - Use issue tracking data for continuous improvement and future project planning. <p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p>"},{"location":"management/lessons-learned/","title":"Lessons Learned","text":"<p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p> Lesson Action Result 1. Importance of Defining Requirements Clearly Clearly and precisely defining the requirements is essential for the successful execution of the project. Early documentation and stakeholder involvement are key. Constant scope changes caused rework and delays. A deeper analysis at the beginning could have saved time and resources. 2. The Importance of Automated Testing The adoption of automated testing was a positive change to improve system reliability and maintenance. Implementing automated tests ensures that changes do not break existing functionality, saving time in the long run. 3. Dependency and Update Management Use version control tools like <code>npm</code>to manage external dependencies and ensure compatibility across all system versions. By managing dependencies and versions effectively, compatibility issues were avoided and stability was ensured. 4. Communication Between Team and Stakeholders Establish regular feedback meetings to ensure all stakeholders are aligned on project goals and deliverables. Improved transparency, aligned expectations, and the ability to adjust priorities based on continuous feedback. 5. The Value of Adequate Documentation Properly document each step of the development process, including system architecture, workflows, and API details. Well-organized documentation made deployment and future updates faster and less prone to errors, facilitating new team member training. 6. Scalability Planning Implement scalability practices such as microservices and load balancing from the start to accommodate growth. The system\u2019s scalability improved, supporting more users and data without sacrificing performance. 7. The Importance of Continuous Integration and Automated Deployment Implement CI/CD pipelines for frequent integration and automation of deployments to ensure faster releases and error identification. Continuous integration and automated delivery reduced production errors and improved team efficiency. 8.

Key Features for Content Management","text":"<p>Strapi includes numerous features critical to our project goals, which we would otherwise need to build and maintain ourselves.</p> <ul> <li>Draft &amp; Publish System: This is a built-in feature that can be enabled per content type. It allows content creators to work on drafts incrementally and only publish them when ready. The API can be configured to only deliver published content to the end-users, which is an essential feature in publisher workflows.</li> <li> <p>Media Library: A comprehensive solution for asset management.</p> <ul> <li>Full CRUD API: All assets can be programmatically uploaded, modified, and deleted.</li> <li>Web UI for Management: The admin panel includes a visual media library for easy manual management. This allows administrators to browse, edit metadata (alt text, captions), and organize assets without needing developer intervention, simplifying long-term maintenance. </li> <li>Format Support: Natively handles images, video, audio, and other files.</li> <li>Optimization: Provides automatic asset optimization, including compression and the generation of responsive formats (small, medium, large), which is crucial for performance on low-end devices.</li> <li>Provider Support: Supports local storage for development and can connect to cloud providers like AWS S3 for production.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Internationalization (i18n): Strapi provides built-in support for managing content in multiple languages, which could be a significant strategic advantage for future growth.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"product/research/strapi-evaluation/#32-flexible-content-modeling-the-content-type-builder","title":"3.2. Flexible Content Modeling (The Content-Type Builder)","text":"<p>The Content-Type Builder is a powerful visual interface within the admin panel for defining our data schemas.

Strapi handles all database management automatically.</li> <li>Component-Based Architecture: I was able to create reusable \"Components\" (like <code>quiz_option</code>) and nest them within larger structures. I also leveraged \"Dynamic Zones\" to create flexible layouts where content creators can mix different types of content (e.g., <code>Lessons</code> and <code>Quizzes</code>) within a <code>Section</code>. This perfectly matches the Figma prototype's requirements. It also allows for flexible future enhancements.</li> </ul> <p> As seen above, a <code>Course Section</code> is modeled with a title, a relation to a <code>Course</code>, and a Dynamic Zone (<code>content_items</code>) that can contain a mix of Lessons or Quizzes.</p>"},{"location":"product/research/strapi-evaluation/#33-developer-experience","title":"3.3. Developer Experience","text":"<p>Strapi is highly developer-oriented and integrates seamlessly into modern workflows.

This creates interactive, self-updating documentation where developers can test endpoints directly from their browser, ensuring the documentation is always in sync with the actual API.</li> <li>Type-Safe Client Generation: The OpenAPI specification allows us to auto-generate a fully typed TypeScript client.
