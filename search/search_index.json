Issue Identification Identify and document issues that may impact the project. - Record issues as they arise during development, testing, or post-launch.  - Classify issues by severity, impact, and urgency.  - Capture detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs. 2. Issue Prioritization Assign priority levels to each issue based on its impact on the project. -Critical : Must be resolved immediately to prevent system failure.  - High : Needs urgent attention to avoid major disruptions.  - Medium : Important but does not affect critical functionalities.  - Low : Minor impact, can be addressed later. 3. Issue Assignment Assign issues to the appropriate team members for resolution. - Allocate issues based on team member expertise and workload.  - Set clear expectations on resolution deadlines and outcomes.  - Provide necessary resources or information for issue resolution. 4. Issue Resolution Resolve issues by implementing fixes or workarounds. - Address root causes of issues to prevent recurrence.  - Implement solutions and verify that the issue is fixed.  - Test thoroughly to ensure that the fix does not introduce new problems. 5. Verification and Closure Verify that resolved issues meet the defined acceptance criteria and close them. - Review the resolution with stakeholders and the team.  - Confirm that the issue no longer affects the project or product.  - Close the issue once it\u2019s resolved and communicate the outcome. 6. Documentation and Reporting Maintain a record of issues, resolutions, and lessons learned. - Update the issue tracking system with detailed information on each issue.  - Generate reports on issues, resolutions, and ongoing challenges.  - Use issue tracking data for continuous improvement and future project planning."},{"location":"project/management/issue-tracking/#revision-history","title":"Revision History","text":""},{"location":"project/management/issue-tracking/#revision-history_1","title":"Revision History","text":"Date Version Changes Authors 03/28/2024 0.1 Document creation Lucas Antunes <p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p>"},{"location":"project/management/lessons-learned/","title":"Lessons Learned","text":"<p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p> Lesson Action Result 1. Importance of Defining Requirements Clearly Clearly and precisely defining the requirements is essential for the successful execution of the project. Early documentation and stakeholder involvement are key. Constant scope changes caused rework and delays. A deeper analysis at the beginning could have saved time and resources. 2. The Importance of Automated Testing The adoption of automated testing was a positive change to improve system reliability and maintenance. Implementing automated tests ensures that changes do not break existing functionality, saving time in the long run. 3. Dependency and Update Management Use version control tools like <code>npm</code>to manage external dependencies and ensure compatibility across all system versions. By managing dependencies and versions effectively, compatibility issues were avoided and stability was ensured. 4. Communication Between Team and Stakeholders Establish regular feedback meetings to ensure all stakeholders are aligned on project goals and deliverables. Improved transparency, aligned expectations, and the ability to adjust priorities based on continuous feedback. 5. The Value of Adequate Documentation Properly document each step of the development process, including system architecture, workflows, and API details. Well-organized documentation made deployment and future updates faster and less prone to errors, facilitating new team member training. 6. Scalability Planning Implement scalability practices such as microservices and load balancing from the start to accommodate growth. The system\u2019s scalability improved, supporting more users and data without sacrificing performance. 7. The Importance of Continuous Integration and Automated Deployment Implement CI/CD pipelines for frequent integration and automation of deployments to ensure faster releases and error identification. Continuous integration and automated delivery reduced production errors and improved team efficiency. 8. Challenges with Subscription Management and Payment Processing Conduct detailed analysis, select payment providers carefully, and implement load testing and payment simulations. Payment and subscription management became more efficient and stable, improving the user experience and system reliability."},{"location":"project/management/lessons-learned/#revision-history","title":"Revision History","text":""},{"location":"project/management/lessons-learned/#revision-history_1","title":"Revision History","text":"Date Version Changes Authors 03/28/2024 0.1 Document creation Lucas Antunes <p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p>"},{"location":"project/management/roadmap/","title":"Project Roadmap","text":"<p>\u2190 Back to Main Page</p>"},{"location":"project/management/roadmap/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The roadmap outlines the phases and steps involved in the development and delivery of the user and content management system solution for stakeholders.
