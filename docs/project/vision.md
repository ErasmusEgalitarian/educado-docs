## Vision Statement

**Educado** envisions a future where waste pickers are not only recognized for their essential environmental role but also empowered through education, technology, and social inclusion.

Our mission is to provide **personal and educational growth opportunities for waste pickers**, enabling them to strengthen their knowledge, improve their working conditions, and access new pathways of professional and personal development.

Through a **mobile-first platform**, co-created with waste pickers and students from the University of Brasília (UnB), **Educado** delivers accessible and engaging content designed to:

* Improve skills and awareness of recycling and waste management.
* Offer structured learning experiences with gamification (points, badges, leaderboards, certificates).
* Provide recognition and incentives that reinforce personal progress and community value.

By placing waste pickers at the core, while engaging students and educators as collaborators, **Educado** aims to foster dignity, inclusion, and continuous learning — strengthening both the circular economy and social equality in the Federal District.
