## Short Term

**Objective**:
Deliver the **MVP in production**. The platform must support core workflows — registration, login, course creation, course consumption — and be validated with real waste pickers and content creators. Documentation, backlog, and governance ensure stability and readiness for incremental improvements.

* **Developers (Aalborg)** → Implement MVP features, architecture, database, and deploy production-ready version.
* **UI/UX Designer** → Deliver production-ready mobile (students) and web (creators) interfaces.
* **PSP2 (Content Creators)** → Produce 2 pilot courses to validate learning experience.
* **PSP5 (Content QA)** → Define quality indicators and design data collection guides to evaluate MVP impact.
* **Gamification Designer (Saxion)** → Draft guidelines for gamified activities to be included in next iterations.
* **Admin & Governance (EGP + PO)** → Approve MVP backlog scope, oversee delivery, and validate release.
* **Cooperatives & Waste Pickers** → Test MVP usability and provide feedback on relevance and accessibility.

## Medium Term

**Objective**:
Expand the platform with **value-adding features**. Focus on **gamification mechanics** (leaderboard, badges, progress tracking), improved usability, and scalable content creation. These features will increase engagement, motivation, and measurable impact.

* **Developers (Aalborg)** → Build gamification modules, dashboards, and enhanced search/filter tools.
* **UI/UX Designer** → Prototype and refine gamified user interactions, ensuring smooth integration.
* **PSP2 (Content Creators)** → Create courses aligned with gamified activities, expanding the content library.
* **PSP5 (Content QA)** → Validate gamification effectiveness and measure adoption with defined indicators.
* **Gamification Designer (Saxion)** → Deliver 4 gamified activity types (by December), with clear rules and guidelines.
* **Admin & Governance (EGP + PO)** → Monitor roadmap execution, ensure alignment with SDGs, and approve feature rollouts.
* **Cooperatives & Waste Pickers** → Validate gamified activities, ensuring they motivate personal and professional growth.

## Long Term

**Objective**:
Establish a **sustainable development and production cycle**. The platform must run on stable processes for documentation, testing, release planning, and international collaboration — scaling across institutions and ensuring continuous growth.

* **Developers (Aalborg)** → Implement CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and international deployment strategy.
* **UI/UX Designer** → Ensure accessibility, multilingual support, and scalable design system.
* **PSP2 (Content Creators)** → Scale course creation with validated guidelines and growing content diversity.
* **PSP5 (Content QA)** → Implement dashboards and long-term indicators to measure course and platform impact.
* **Gamification Designer (Saxion)** → Maintain and expand the library of gamified activities.
* **Admin & Governance (EGP + PO)** → Provide governance logs, compliance checks, and stakeholder reporting.
* **Universities (UnB, Aalborg, Saxion, Minho)** → Maintain cross-border collaboration and research for innovation.
* **Cooperatives & Waste Pickers** → Continue as co-creators of feedback loops, ensuring the platform drives personal and educational growth.
