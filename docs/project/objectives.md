# Objectives

## Short Term

**Objective**:  
The short-term objective is to have the software fully documented and an effective stabilization plan implemented. This involves ensuring that the most critical aspects of the software are well-documented, with a clear roadmap for identifying and addressing immediate issues.

## Medium Term

**Objective**:  
The medium-term goal is to begin incrementally adding new features. This stage focuses on enhancing the software by implementing functionalities that deliver added value and improve the overall user experience.

## Long Term

**Objective**:  
The long-term goal is to establish a sustainable development and production cycle. This includes setting up robust processes and best practices to enable continuous, efficient, and high-quality software development, deployment, and maintenance.
