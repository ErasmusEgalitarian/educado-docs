# Project Overview

[← Back to Main Page](../index.md)

## Context

In modern IT infrastructures, ensuring the reliability and availability of servers and services is crucial. The growing complexity of server environments and the increasing volume of data generated by these systems have created a pressing need for real-time monitoring and proactive anomaly detection.

This project aims to address these challenges by creating a scalable real-time monitoring platform. The system will leverage advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to monitor server health, detect performance anomalies, and alert system administrators to potential issues before they escalate into failures.

The short-term focus is on developing a well-documented and stable foundation for the platform, ensuring that critical functionalities are implemented and immediate issues are addressed. Medium-term efforts will concentrate on incrementing new features, such as machine learning-based anomaly detection and enhanced user experience. In the long term, the project seeks to establish a robust development and production cycle, enabling continuous improvement and high-quality software deployment.

Ultimately, this initiative is designed to reduce downtime, increase operational efficiency, and minimize the need for manual intervention in server management, thereby improving the overall stability and reliability of IT systems.

### Objectives and Scope

#### Objectives

**Short Term:**  
Develop a plan to have a scalable Ready to Use Software Product(RUSP). RUSP are packages sold to the acquirer who had no influence on its features and other qualities. Ensure the system is well-documented and has a stabilization plan in place to address immediate issues aiming:
- Requirements for product description
- Requirements for user documentation
- Quality requirements for software

**Medium Term:**  
Increment new features by implementing machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and real-time server data, detecting anomalies and predicting potential hardware failures. Enhance the system’s functionalities to improve user experience and operational efficiency.

Develop a software production proccess with Denmark and Brazilian software team to implement new issues aiming:
- Requirements for test documentation
- Instructions for conformity evaluation
- Realease product alpha

**Long Term:**  
Establish a healthy development and production cycle by designing an alerting system that notifies administrators of detected issues through various channels, including email, SMS, and integration with messaging platforms like Slack. Create an intuitive dashboard to provide administrators with real-time insights into server status, trends, and health indicators, enabling continuous, efficient, and high-quality software development and deployment.

#### Scope

**Included:**

* Real-time data collection from servers running various operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.).
* Integration with existing IT infrastructure tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, and Prometheus.
* Machine learning models to detect performance anomalies and predict potential failures based on historical data.
* Alerting system with customizable thresholds and multi-channel notifications.
* Visual dashboard for displaying server health and performance metrics.

**Not Included:**

* Monitoring of non-server infrastructure components such as databases, network devices, or virtual machines (though these may be included in future iterations).
* Full end-to-end security monitoring (the focus is primarily on performance monitoring and anomaly detection).
* Monitoring for non-production environments (e.g., development and staging environments).
