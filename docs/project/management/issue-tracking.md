## **Issue Tracking Process**

| **Stage**                          | **Objective**                                                              | **Key Actions/Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Issue Identification**        | Identify and document issues that may impact the project.                        | - Record issues as they arise during development, testing, or post-launch.  - Classify issues by severity, impact, and urgency.  - Capture detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs.                                                                 |
| **2. Issue Prioritization**        | Assign priority levels to each issue based on its impact on the project.         | -**Critical** : Must be resolved immediately to prevent system failure.  - **High** : Needs urgent attention to avoid major disruptions.  - **Medium** : Important but does not affect critical functionalities.  - **Low** : Minor impact, can be addressed later. |
| **3. Issue Assignment**            | Assign issues to the appropriate team members for resolution.                    | - Allocate issues based on team member expertise and workload.  - Set clear expectations on resolution deadlines and outcomes.  - Provide necessary resources or information for issue resolution.                                                                                          |
| **4. Issue Resolution**            | Resolve issues by implementing fixes or workarounds.                             | - Address root causes of issues to prevent recurrence.  - Implement solutions and verify that the issue is fixed.  - Test thoroughly to ensure that the fix does not introduce new problems.                                                                                                |
| **5. Verification and Closure**    | Verify that resolved issues meet the defined acceptance criteria and close them. | - Review the resolution with stakeholders and the team.  - Confirm that the issue no longer affects the project or product.  - Close the issue once it’s resolved and communicate the outcome.                                                                                             |
| **6. Documentation and Reporting** | Maintain a record of issues, resolutions, and lessons learned.                   | - Update the issue tracking system with detailed information on each issue.  - Generate reports on issues, resolutions, and ongoing challenges.  - Use issue tracking data for continuous improvement and future project planning.                                                          |
