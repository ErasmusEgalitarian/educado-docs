# 📦 Deliveries Index

## Overview  
This section gathers all **Product Backlog Item (PBI)** documentation from each team.  
The goal is to keep track of what was delivered during each sprint.

---

## Structure  
Inside the `docs/deliveries/` folder, there are three subfolders:
---
    ├── web/
    ├── mobile/
    └── backend/
---

Each team should create a **Markdown file** in its respective folder for every PBI delivered.

---

## Naming Convention  
Use the following pattern for your file names:


**Examples:**  
- `US-012-internationalization.md`  
- `US-004-student-login.md`  
- `US-001-registration-flow.md`

---

## Purpose  
This directory serves as a **record of deliveries** organized by domain (Web, Mobile, Backend).  
Details about how to contribute and submit new documentation are available in the corresponding GitHub task.
